moviedb-search-engine
=====================

Search engine for a db of movie descriptions. Data Structures final project.
On program start the engine itself is built, this takes approximately 40 secs.
Afterwards you enter one or two words and the top three movies that have the word(s)
repeated the most times will be displayed.
The Parsedfile class was given to us, so it's not my code, but the rest of the projects is original code.
